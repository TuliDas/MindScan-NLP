"I had the cigarettes checked out and ready to go, but then I told the cashier to put them back",addiction,"Proud of me. Lmao it must have been so clear to the cashier that I‚Äôm a struggling addict. The lustful look she must have seen in my eyes... 

I haven‚Äôt smoked a full cig in months, but the other day I mixed some tobacco with weed and it was glorious. But now my cravings are crazyyyyy. I WANT THEM. But my willpower remains strong enough.

Close call today, but I‚Äôm still going cigaretteless.",Addiction
Am I exaggerating?,StopDrinking,"Am I bad for wanting to cut off my friend because she noticed I was blacked out and throwing up in an Uber and instead of helping me trying to sober up she still drove me to a party and I ended up throwing up in front of everyone, this was my first blackout experience and it has never happened to me before.",Addiction
Bad days don‚Äôt erase progress,addiction,"Some days in recovery feel amazing, and some days feel just as heavy as before. I used to think having a bad day meant I was failing, but I‚Äôve learned that‚Äôs just part of the process. Progress isn‚Äôt a straight line.

Finding support through Better Addiction Care reminded me that it‚Äôs okay to stumble, as long as you keep going. My advice: don‚Äôt give up when the hard days hit. They don‚Äôt erase the work you‚Äôve already done.",Addiction
Everyday feels like a struggle and a test. Does it get easier?,StopDrinking,"The addictive pathways I've created in my brain feel set in stone. Everyday my addict brain is convincing myself why it'll be fine to get drunk tonight. It's taking so much fortitude to not listen to him and shut it out. 

I feel like a broken dam being held up with toothpicks and bubblegum. I'm sober tonight, but what about tomorrow? 

I wish I never met alcohol.",Addiction
Can‚Äôt hold a job because I can‚Äôt sleep due to stress feeling trapped in an endless cycle,anxiety,"I‚Äôm stuck in a frustrating cycle where my lack of sleep is messing up everything especially my job. I work in construction, and the stress of not being able to wake up on time or get enough rest is driving me crazy. The lack of sleep makes me angry over stupid things ,It‚Äôs like the sleep deprivation is making everything worse and I‚Äôm constantly on edge.

I‚Äôve tried to reach out for help, but it often feels like it‚Äôs not being taken seriously. People have said things like it‚Äôs not a real issue, or that I‚Äôm just making excuses for not trying hard enough. It‚Äôs tough when you feel like people don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs going on, and it just adds to the stress.

It feels like I‚Äôm losing my mind.",Anxiety
Please READ ü´Ç,anxiety,"Hi everyone, I wanted to ask if anyone has experienced something similar. I often feel these sudden ‚Äúspasms‚Äù in my head, almost like electric shocks or zaps. Other times it feels like a tingling sensation that spreads through my head. It‚Äôs very strange and uncomfortable, and it makes me panic because when it happens, I forget things or feel really out of it. Sometimes I even worry it could be seizures.

I recently had a CT scan, and the doctors told me nothing serious showed up, but I keep experiencing this often and it‚Äôs really worrying me.

Has anyone else gone through this? What did it turn out to be for you?",Anxiety
Does anyone else hate when you have to do something the next day? Like you can‚Äôt be at peace until you get it over with?,anxiety,"I get this everyday of my life. I can never live in the moment. I‚Äôll be having fun for a second and then i‚Äôll remind myself that i have to do something the next day and it makes me anxious, restless, annoyed and stressed the whole time. 

Do you guys experience this kind of anxiety? If so, how do you deal with it? 

How do you learn to live in the moment and not for the next day?",Anxiety
First time I got through a sever physical panic attack without having to take my Xanax and I‚Äôm really proud of myself.,PanicAttack,"EDIT: Severe


Not really sure what else to put, just wanted to share with someone. It‚Äôs been 6 years of crippling attacks and this is the only time I‚Äôve successfully rode the wave entirely, used breathing and grounding to get through it without going to the hospital or taking my benzos.",Anxiety

LPT: If your employer puts you on a pip (personal improvement plan). Start applying for a new job right away.,LifeProTips,"In my experience employees Ive seen put on them rarely keep their jobs after the improvement period deadline is up even if they put in the effort to meet the goals. Its more or less a gentle way of fireing someone. 

Put in the work and try your hardest. But expect they will let you go when its up.",Normal
LPT: wear shoes with a wide toebox,LifeProTips,"The shoes that we wear for dressy occasions (and some casual) are bad for our feet and toes.  Smushing up your toes can lead to bunions, hammer toes, and discomfort.

Don‚Äôt do it! Start wearing a wide toe box young and save your feet. 

Side note: many props to the girls that started the trend of wearing sneakers with prom dresses. May it continue on forever.",Normal

Got recruited for an interesting job (in AI Governance!) as a recent high school grad,happy,"A recruiter contacted me today due to a referral, inviting me to apply for a senior position at a new AI Governance position at an NGO, working alongside researchers and ethicists from Yale, Oxford etc. As if that wasn't awesome enough already, it's 115000$/year+ depending on experience. 

I double checked this and it's legit. I have a lot of experience in the field but I wouldn't have ever expected such an invitation as someone who only recently graduated high school. And considering that my dream is to work at Anthropic...I don't know, I feel super happy to even be invited (and referred by a mysterious someone who thinks of me so highly lol)",Normal
LPT: Don't let people guilt you for not being in contact with them. They're not making any effort to stay connected with you either.,LifeProTips,"I was talking with my aunt today and she was mentioning how I never call her. I felt pretty bad at the time. But, I realized that she is equally capable of calling me and she isn't doing it either. So, don't let people guilt you for doing exactly what they are doing to you(or not doing in this case)

Edit: A lot of people are lashing out at me in the comments. To clarify, I don't mean your grandma, who doesn't know how to use the phone or people trying to contact you but not able to. I am referring to people who are able to contact you but never do and complain how little you call/text them.",Normal

Goodbye,SuicideWatch,"\*\*UPDATE: I didn't do it. I made myself go to sleep. I didn't get all my letters/goodbyes done the way I needed to. Right now I feel empty, in a daze. I know I will lose this battle one day, but I'm kinda glad it wasn't last night. Also, thanks to all the people who commented that they care, means so much.\*\*

Hopefully, this is my last post. I'm not posting this for attention or pity, it's merely to show I was here, I was a person.

Right now nothing and everything hurts at the same time. I can't breathe, I can't stop crying. Why am I this weak, it's a disgrace to humankind.

I can't take this anymore. I'm sorry to all the people I love, even If the love was not returned.

Thanks for the memories life. Goodbye.
