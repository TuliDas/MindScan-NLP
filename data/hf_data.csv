Using a ADHD Diagnosis from the US In Canada,ADHD,"Hi everyone!

I'm currently undergoing ADHD testing in the US, if I get my diagnosis (hopefully) could I use that same diagnosis to get medicated in Canada? See I'm moving to Canada for a PhD starting on May, and I was wondering if I need to start from scratch to get a diagnosis in a CanadÃ¡ or my US diagnosis would work?",ADHD
Keeping promises,ADHD,"Anyone else have trouble keeping promises? Or rather making unrealistic promises in the first place? 

I hate myself right now.  I tell people I can and will do all these things for them. All I want is someone to be proud of me. 

It feels like I make all of these promises because I want to impress someone or try and be a good friend and then forget or just cant manage to come through. 

I feel like I have everything worked out and tonight I sat and cried thinking about all the promises I tried to keep and couldnâ€™t, or worse yet, the amount I have made and now I have deadlines to get them done and I know Iâ€™m not good enough to get them done. 

Why do I still make these promises after I always disappoint? Anyone relate?",ADHD
What are some side effects of ADHD meds?,ADHD,Since I got diagnosed with ADHD about 2 years ago I have never once tried medication. I'm going to try it out soon if the doctor recommends it. But I wanted to know if there was anything I should know before trying to take them. I wanted to know from people with possible experience with ADHD before. If there is anything I should watch out or I should know please let me know in a comment.,ADHD
Methylphenidate for better sleep,ADHD,"I was prescribed methylphenidate medication two months ago. It works pretty well during the day. My doctor warned me that it MAY cause sleeping problems.
But it's quite the opposite which I found by accident actually.
10mg pill, then I had my best meditation session in months, the went right to sleep without running thoughts.
It worked few days later so I believe my meds calm me down and don't make me hyperactive.
So maybe somebody else heard that meds can disrupt sleep. But you may try it in the evening for getting calm, of course after consulting with your doctor.",ADHD
adderall IR giving anxiety,ADHD,"Hey all! I was diagnosed with ADHD at 15 and went on meds a few months later at 16. Iâ€™ve been on adderall XR 10 mg for about a month, but it was wearing off early in the day, so my doc decided to prescribe me 10mg IR to take later in the day. Iâ€™ve only taken my IR a few times, but it seems to give me anxiety (the XR does not.) My pcp thinks I have anxiety and is waiting until my adhd meds are sorted out before deciding if she wants to prescribe or treat the anxiety. But the IR is giving me massive anxiety, where the XR does not. Is this normal for the IR, and will it go away as I take it more, or is this a cause of concern I should voice? Any insight is greatly appreciated :)",ADHD
Feeling left behind,depression,"I feel like I'm not progressing fast enough. People i graduated high school with are graduating college but I'm not even close. I'm working a warehouse job that i hate, i still live with my parents, I'm not smart, and I don't have my life together. I have people I could reach out to but every time i start to, i panic and back out. I can't even ask friends for or tell them how i feel. I feel bad always wearing a mask and telling them I'm fine, but it's second nature at this point.",Depression
I just want to feel something even if it's pain,depression,"I need to feel something, i feel im pure void right now, i don't care what the feeling is, from intense pain, love or a drug idk i just need something that makes this void disappear, this sensation of emptiness i have is to much to handle, right now i feel like im just flesh with nothing inside.

Idc if someone read this i just want at least the me of tomorrow acknowledge what the me of this night is going through and not just act like it never existed",Depression
I donâ€™t know what to do or how to..,depression,"I recently went through a break up and itâ€™s the only thing on my mind. I donâ€™t feel like eating, I donâ€™t feel like getting up. Iâ€™ve been crying in bed and I want to drink again but Iâ€™ve been a few months clean and I donâ€™t want to go there. At the same time I donâ€™t care. I want to get up. I want to get snacks from the store or something. But i just cry and cry. I feel like I lost my home, the person I envisioned my whole life with. The lump in my throat hurts and I just want to stop feeling sad.",Depression
What to do about suicide obsession?,depression,"I've been at the very least fascinated with the idea of suicide since I was about 8, and lately it's been this insane obsession. Its all that's on my mind, it's almost the only thing I think about anymore and talk about and dream about. Im in love with every aspect of it and I can never seem to mentally get away from it. Anybody else going through the same shit or have suggestions? I feel like I'm really losing my mind.",Depression
I'm thinking about killing myself.,depression,"I think about it sometimes, but my brother struggles with depression as well, and recently tried to walk into traffic. I always reason that if I die, then who will stop my brother or sister from killing themselves.

Keep going and keep fighting the bully.,OCD,"Hey guys! Iâ€™m currently having one of the worst attacks of OCD Iâ€™ve ever had, and just was thinking about all of you going through the same thing as me. I just want to tell you all to keep going, thereâ€™s been multiple times tonight Iâ€™ve felt myself wanting give up on life but I have a person that i love so much I could never leave them. Not everybody has this and it can be easy to give up, so I want to say I know how much you hurt and I know how hard it is to keep going but do it, thereâ€™s people who care for you and if you donâ€™t believe there are, I care for you. Take care of yourselves keep going get professional help when your comfortable and it will get better. Iâ€™ve beaten it in the past and I will again and so will you. ðŸ§¡ you all.",OCD

Is this OCD?,OCD,"So one thing that Iâ€™ve become fed up with is how my mind will make a random association connection with something and that will remain in my head for weeks, months or years. A classic example is if Iâ€™m meditating for example And suddenly a thought or image of something will come to mind. I try not to think too much of it but it remains in my mind. And then it gets stuck. So then everytime I meditate that intrusive thought or image comes to mind and it absolutely ruins my meditation. Iâ€™m just sick of it. All I can do is wait for life to pass by and my brain to fill up with more junk so that I forget this association. Does anyone face this type of experience?",OCD
Im tired of this,OCD,I watched a video on why I hate religion and love Jesus and now my minds saying that jesus wants me to do bad things and i feel like ive went over the deep end and im crazy now. Why would jesus want me to do these horrible things? Why does it feel like I believe it?,OCD
Sick to my stomach,ptsd,"TW mention of sexual abuse
I honestly feel sick to my stomach. Gradually the bits and pieces are coming back from my past
Memories of being literally like 3/4. Handcuffed to a bed in the dark scared. I always remembered the hand cuffed part but not the whole context.
I've had nightmares of being naked in that room.
Really young. Having an unexplained black eye... That feeling of shame and being idk polluted by it? I was talking to someone about it today and its the first time I really spoke about it and I just feel so sick
Anyone else experience this",PTSD
I hear voices as part of my PTSD and they're so loud tonight,ptsd,"Before this lockdown started I hadn't heard voices in months and was doing really well, now they're so loud that I can't sleep and it's 2:30am where I am. They're saying really nasty things too and trying to get me to hurt myself. I won't, I'm fairly used to coping with them these days but I just want to sleep. Sorry for the rant.",PTSD
Confusing things,ptsd,"When I smile while crying it feels numb. It feels like my insane feelings and actions are all fake. Just hollow lies I tell and do because I sick of life feeling like its going nowhere. 
But it doesn't always feel fake. There are times where it's so real I feel like doing something irrational to ease the feeling. When I cant tell if I'm really crying because I'm upset or because I'm just so used to it it feels like something i should be doing everyday like showering or breathing.
I have no idea honestly. I just wanna know if anyone else feels suffocated by their own life or thoughts or feelings?",PTSD
Weighted Blankets,ptsd,"Has anyone used them to help with sleep, or the panic symptoms? I'm interested, but don't want to drop the 100+ if it isn't really helpful.",PTSD
I'm having trouble locating the feeling of discomfort when triggered.,ptsd,"I'm guessing the most obvious location is the chest or stomach? When I encounter my trigger, my mind usually goes blank, and it's hard to focus on a bodily sensation. I think I get a fuzzy feeling or temperature rise in my shoulders or head as I freak out. Therapist wants me to focus on the specific body part during treatment. But I never seem to have an answer as to where I feel the discomfort.",PTSD
